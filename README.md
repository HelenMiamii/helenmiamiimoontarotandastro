# helenmiamiimoontarotandastro

This is a responsive, simple, and creative design for my Tarot and Astrology brand. I feel this site can be a great template for any Artist that offers a service and is looking to streamline the booking process for their clients.

This website is built on Gatsby.js using React and React-Bootstrap.

I used Square Appointments to create the Customer Booking feature. It's in a modal activated by a button that says "Book Your Sesh". To replace this with your own Square Appointments account, start by creating an Advance Widget in your Square Appointments account. Only copy the href url in the entire code generated for you (doesn't matter which one). Go to your directory, "../src/components", open the square.js file, then paste the link as the script.src. Viola!
