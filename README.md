# HelenMiamiiMoonTarotandAstro

This is a responsive, simple, and creative website for my Tarot and Astrology brand "Helen Miamii Moon". This site can be a great template for an Artist that offers bookable services and is looking to streamline that booking process for their clients.

This website is built on Gatsby.js using React and React-Bootstrap.

I used Square Appointments to create the Customer Booking feature. It's in a modal activated by a button that says "Book Your Sesh". To replace this with your own Square Appointments account, start by creating an Advance Widget in your Square Appointments account. Only copy the href url in the entire code generated for you (doesn't matter which one). Go to your directory, "../src/components", open the square.js file, then paste the link as the script.src. Viola!
